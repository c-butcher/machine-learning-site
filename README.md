# Machine Learning Site

This website will allow you to upload a spreadsheet or CSV file, and run that information through
a machine learning algorithm such as Linear Regression, Logistical Regression or K-Nearest Neighbor.
When complete, the site will also generate a web form based on the input data, which will then
deliver predictions.
